## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

You can install the requirements with:

## ðŸ’¡ What the App Does
- Prompts the user to input the path of a local image
- Uses MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet) to classify the image
- Displays the image and top 3 predictions with confidence percentages
- Repeats the process until the user exits
